Inventory Replenish Report

Help
## Help

Report lists products to be replenished. Note that a product can have only one current vendor. If there are more then vendor per product, both records are reset.  You need to select a current vendor manually.
Movements are only created, if a sourcing warehouse is defined for the warehouse to be replenished.

Aging Report with payments (revalued)

Help
## Help

The aging report allows you to report on Open Items (Invoices and Payments) as at the date selected. Select the aging buckets, you want to have in your report. All amounts are converted to the currency of the select accounting schema, using the rate for the selected currency conversion type and as at the statement date. If you do not select a Statement Date, the system date is used. If you do not list the individual invoices, the Due Date is the earliest due date for the business partner and the Due Days are the average due days of all invoices.*

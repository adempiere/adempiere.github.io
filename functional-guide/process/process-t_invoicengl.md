Invoice Not Realized Gain & Loss Report

Help
## Help

The Report lists not fully paid invoices with open amount, the GL amounts and the revalued amounts.  If an invoice is partially paid, the percentage of the open amount is used to calculate the revaluation amount.
If you select a currency, only invoices of that currency are included; if you select Include All Currencies, all invoices are included and you can use the report to reconcile your AP/AR accounts.
If you select a GL Document Type, a GL Journal is created. 
Note that the report only includes posted invoices.

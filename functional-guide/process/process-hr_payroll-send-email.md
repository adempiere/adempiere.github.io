 *The Mail Template indicates the mail template for return messages. Mail text can include variables.  The priority of parsing is User/Contact, Business Partner and then the underlying business object (like Request, Dunning, Workflow object).

For Multi-Lingual systems, the template is translated based on the Business Partner's language selection.*

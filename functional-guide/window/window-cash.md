Cash
### Cash

**Description**
 *Payment or Receipt*
**Help**
 *Enter payment or receipt for a Business Partner.  If it is for a single invoice it can be allocated directly to that invoice using this screen. You can also apply over/under payments:
You have an over-payment, if you received more money than due for a single invoice. Instead of writing the difference off (i.e. would be a gain), you can leave the amount unallocated and use it for later invoices or credit memos. Please note that the Amount is the payment amount, so you need to enter the over-payment as a negative amount.
You can also receive a partial payment (under-payment). If you decide not to write off the remaining invoice amount, enter the under-payment as a positive amount.
Note that printed payments are archived in Payment Selection (Prepared Payment).
* For Posting, the bank account organization is used, if it is not a charge.*

```
The Single Row Layout checkbox indicates if the default display type for this window is a single row as opposed to multi row.
If not selected, the user cannot create a new Record.  This is automatically disabled, if the Tab is Read Only.

# Forecast Definition


This window allows to define the valid combinations, used to select the historic sales records. The combinations order is determined by the sequence, where the lower sequence has priority over the higher sequence.

Help
## Help

The information to define combinations are defined by business partner data (business partner, business partner group, sales region and campaign), Product data (product, category, classification, class and group), factor data for calculus (Alpha Factor, Gamma, Multiplier, Scale).


The suitable use of the forecast definition, allows to generate calculus with different factors for each main group of data defined for a business partner or product.


In this way is possible to get a forecast for each product category, different from another.


To set the sequence of the combinations is possible to use the tab of sequences, with which is possible to define the order of each combination.

 *The record is active in the system*
**Help**
 *There are two methods of making records unavailable in the system: One is to delete the record, the other is to de-activate the record. A de-activated record is not available for selection, but available for reports.
There are two reasons for de-activating and not deleting records:
(1) The system requires the record for audit purposes.
(2) The record is referenced by other records. E.g., you cannot delete a Business Partner, if there are invoices for this partner record existing. You de-activate the Business Partner and prevent that this record is used for future entries.*

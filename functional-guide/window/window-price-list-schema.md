 *Pricelists are created based on Product Purchase and Category Discounts.
The parameters listed here allow to copy and calculate pricelists.
The calculation:
<UL>
<LI>Copy and convert price from referenced price list
<LI>result plus Surcharge Amount
<LI>result minus Discount
<LI>if resulting price is less than the original limit price plus min Margin, use this price (only if Margin is not zero)
<LI>if resulting price is more than the original limit price plus max Margin, use this price (only if Margin us not zero)
<LI>Round resulting price
</UL>
\ **The Formula**\  is
NewPrice = (Convert(BasePrice) + Surcharge) * (100-Discount) / 100;
if MinMargin <> 0 then NewPrice = Max (NewPrice, Convert(OrigLimitPrice) + MinMargin);
if MaxMargin <> 0 then NewPrice = Min (NewPrice, Convert(OrigLimitPrice) + MaxMargin);
 
\ **Example:**\  (assuming same currency)
Original Prices:  List=300, Standard=250, Limit=200;
New List Price: Base=List, Surcharge=0, Discount=0, Round*

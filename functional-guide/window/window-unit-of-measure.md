Maintain Unit of Measure 

Help
## Help

The Unit of Measure Window is used to define non monetary units of measure.  It also defines if conversion between units of measure are allowed and how they are to be performed. The system provides some automatic conversions between units of measures (e.g. minute, hour, day, working day, etc.) if they are not explicitly defined here.
Conversions need to be direct (i.e. if you have only a conversion between A-B and B-C, the system cannot convert A-C, you need to define it explicitly).

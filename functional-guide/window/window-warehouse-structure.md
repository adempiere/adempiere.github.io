## Help

In order to Implement the Warehouse Management functionality, you need to configure a logical mapping of your warehouse that accurately matches its physical layout. Warehouses are usually subdivided into Areas, Sections, and Locations, therefore it has the ability to handle multiple warehouse areas and each can be further divided into different sections as well.

Finally, warehouse sections can be grouped into different locations and section types.

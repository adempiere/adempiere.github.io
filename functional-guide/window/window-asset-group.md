There are two reasons for de-activating and not deleting records:
(1) The system requires the record for audit purposes.
(2) The record is referenced by other records. E.g., you cannot delete a Business Partner, if there are invoices for this partner record existing. You de-activate the Business Partner and prevent that this record is used for future entries.*

Maintain Counter Document Types

Help
## Help

When using explicit documents for inter-org transaction (after linking a Business Partner to an Organization), you can determine what document type the counter document is based on the document type of the original transaction.  Example: a "Standard Order" creates a "Standard PO". 
If you define a relationship here, you overwrite the default counter document type in the Document Type definition. This allows you to define a specific mapping.
If not defined, the first matching document type is used (e.g. AR Invoice - first AP Invoice document type)

**Description**
 *The record is active in the system*
**Help**
 *There are two methods of making records unavailable in the system: One is to delete the record, the other is to de-activate the record. A de-activated record is not available for selection, but available for reports.
There are two reasons for de-activating and not deleting records:
(1) The system requires the record for audit purposes.
(2) The record is referenced by other records. E.g., you cannot delete a Business Partner, if there are invoices for this partner record existing. You de-activate the Business Partner and prevent that this record is used for future entries.*

Distribution Resource Planning (DRP) is a method used in business administration for planning orders within a supply chain. 

DRP enables the user to set certain inventory control parameters (like a safety stock) and calculate the time-phased inventory requirements.

DRP uses several variables:
the on-hand inventory at the end of a period.
the backordered demand at the end of a period.
the required quantity of product needed at the beginning of a period.
the constrained quantity of product available at the beginning of a period.
the recommended order quantity at the beginning of a period.

DRP needs the following information:
the demand in a future period.
the scheduled receipts at the beginning of a period.
the safety stock requirement for a period.
the on-hand inventory at the beginning of a period.

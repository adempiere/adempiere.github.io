Synchronize Document Translation

Help
## Help

If the current client has not multi-lingual documents enabled, the translations for documents are synchronized with the main record (i.e. it copies the content of the main record to the translation records).  This process is necessary when swiching to a mono-lingual environment as there the terminoligy is maintained not in the translation records.
This applies to the client defined document translations, e.g. for UoM, Payment Terms, Product Info, etc.

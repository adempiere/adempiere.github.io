Aging Report

Help
## Help

The aging report allows you to report on Open Items (Invoices). Select the aging buckets, you want to have in your report. If you select a currency, you get only invoices of that currency, otherwise the amounts are converted to your primary accounting currency. If you do not select a Statement Date, the system date is used to calculate the buckets. If you do not list the individual invoices, the Due Date is the earliest due date for the business partner and the Due Days are the average due days of all invoices.

If you select an Account Date the report will generate the Aging as of that date. The report will exclude documents after the selected date.

For example: A customer has one invoice for $100 with the Account Date of 03/31/08 and one payment for $100 with the Account Date of 05/01/08. The report will show the following balances based on the Account Date selected: 03/15/08= 0; 04/15/08=100; 05/15/08 = 0.

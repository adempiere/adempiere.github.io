Maintain language translation in system

Help
## Help

You can Add Missing Translation entries (required after activating an additional System Language) - Delete Translation Records - or Re-Create the translation Records (first delete and add missing entries).
Note that Adding the Missing Translation records creates them by copying the System Language (English).  You would apply the Language Pack after that process.  Run Syncronize Terminology after importing the translation.

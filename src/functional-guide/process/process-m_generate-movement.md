# Generate Movement


Generate and print Movement from open Distribution Orders

Help
## Help

Movement for open Distribution Orders are created based on the delivery rule of the Distribution Order and the relative order priority.  If a Promise Date is selected only orders up to (including) the date are selected.
If several Distribution Orders of a business partner have the same location, the Distribution orders can be consolidated into one Movement.
You can also include Distibution orders who have outstanding confirmations (e.g. ordered=10 - not confirmed movements=4 - would create a new movement of 6 if available).

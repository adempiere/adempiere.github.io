## Help

The form shows at the upper side static information around the product and the manufacturing resource where it has to be made, it also shows a summary of the quantities to be controlled in the MO such as the Original and delivered quantities and the Quantity to deliver for the MO up to date.

If the production process requires production in batch, then the Qty Batchs shows the Number of batches the shop floor needs to do and the Qty Batch Size contains the size of every batch to be produced.


If you want to issue the MO components before you receive the finished product you should tick the checkbox Is Delivery, this case is recommended when you have a long to medium lead time and you want to have the inventory quantities as reliable as possible at every moment.

If you have small lead time and you wish to save clerk time then you must tick Is Backflush checkbox and you will receive the finished product at the same time you issue automatically the components

The Backflush Group field is used when you want to issue just components belonging to this group. (This characteristic could not be included in the current version).

At the lower part of the window you can find the list of every MO component, this can be modified according with the real products and quantities given to the shop floor.

The quantities to be issued are selected with the checkbox at the first column of the list of components. If the actual quantity is different from the standard quantity showed in the column Qty to deliver you should edit this field to enter the right quantity to be issued.

Finally a message box asks if you want to close the OM document, you should click the ok button if this MO does not have any more transactions and has to be closed.

Maintain Languages

Help
## Help

The Language Window allows you to define multiple parallel language for users. This allows users to access the same data but have the windows, tabs and fields appear in different languages.
If a language is a System Language, you can change the User Interface to this language (after translation).  Otherwise the language is only used for printing documents.

For the language code, we suggest using the Java convention of country and language (e.g. fr_CN - Canadian French).

Verify the translation creates missing translation records. Start this process after creating a new language.

### Active

**Description**
 *The record is active in the system*
**Help**
 *There are two methods of making records unavailable in the system: One is to delete the record, the other is to de-activate the record. A de-activated record is not available for selection, but available for reports.
There are two reasons for de-activating and not deleting records:
(1) The system requires the record for audit purposes.
(2) The record is referenced by other records. E.g., you cannot delete a Business Partner, if there are invoices for this partner record existing. You de-activate the Business Partner and prevent that this record is used for future entries.*

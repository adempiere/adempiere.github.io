Maintain Clients/Tenants

Help
## Help

The Client is the highest level of an independent business entity.  Each Client will have one or more Organizations reporting to it.  Each Client defines the accounting parameters (Accounting Schema, Tree definition, Non Monetary UOM's). To create new Clients, run the Initial Client Setup with the System Administrator Role.
Do not create a new client in this window, but use "Initial Client Setup" to set up the required security and access rules. If you create a new client here, you will not be able to view it and also the required client infrastructure would not have been set up.

 *The record is active in the system*
**Help**

(1) The system requires the record for audit purposes.
(2) The record is referenced by other records. E.g., you cannot delete a Business Partner, if there are invoices for this partner record existing. You de-activate the Business Partner and prevent that this record is used for future entries.*
